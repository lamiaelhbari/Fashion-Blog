# Fashion Blog Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create a fashion blog. The objective is to design a new website in time for New York Fashion Week. 

This involves practicing basic HTML knowledge (elements and structure) to establish the fundamental structure of the blog, incorporating plenty of images, links, lists, and other HTML elements, so that fans have an abundance of content to explore.
